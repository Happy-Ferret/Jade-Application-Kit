## Introduction

## This is a DEV Preview!
Development may be slow as i am busy!

 JAK is built in Python 3 on top of GTK3 and Webkit2.
 It is only dependent on PyGi module you should have it pre packaged in any linux distro!
  * further reading about Pygi [here](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/PyGObject).
  
You can write hybrid Web and Desktop applications on Linux in a webview, including but not limited to DOCKS, Widgets, or any other sort of apps.
 This works same way as Node Webkit or Electron with a few diferences.
 
## Features
 * You can use any scripting language you like (PHP, Python, Ruby, Javascript)!
 * Use HTML5, CSS3 or Webgl.
 * Use any backend server or none at all!
 * Have your applications run in the browser with websockets using the GTK Broadway backend.
 
## Known Issues
 * Broadway backend segfaults.
 * Transparent windows are exprimental.
 * Missing options in app.json will throw an error and crash you app.
 * Theres no way of positioning windows in the screen that was not implemented yet but it will be.
