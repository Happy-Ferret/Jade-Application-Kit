## Introduction

## This is a DEV Preview!
Development may be slow as i am busy!

 JAK is built in Python 3 on top of GTK3 and Webkit2.
 It is only dependent on PyGi module you should have it pre packaged in any linux distro!
  
You can write hybrid Web and Desktop applications on Linux in a webview, including but not limited to DOCKS, Widgets, or any other sort of apps.
 This works same way as Node Webkit or Electron with a few diferences.
 
## Features
 * You can use any scripting language you like (PHP, Python, Ruby, Javascript)!
 * Use HTML5, CSS3 or Webgl.
 * Use any backend server or none at all!
 * Have your applications run in the browser with websockets using the GTK Broadway backend.
 
## Known Issues
 * broadway backend segfaults.
 * Transparent windows are exprimental, window shadows that should not be there wen using transparent window in Dock mode.
 * missing options in app.json will throw an error and crash you app.
 * theres no way of positioning windows in the screen that was not implemented yet but it will be.
 
## SUGESTIONS ARE WELCOME!
