Development may be slow as i am busy!

JAK is built in Python 3 on top of GTK3 and Webkit2. It is only
dependent on PyGi module you should have it pre packaged in any linux
distro! \* further reading about Pygi

You can write hybrid Web and Desktop applications on Linux in a webview,
including but not limited to DOCKS, Widgets, or any other sort of apps.

   Javascript)!

   GTK Broadway backend.
