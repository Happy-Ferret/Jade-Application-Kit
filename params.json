You can write hybrid Web and Desktop applications on top of a webview, including but not limited to DOCKS, Widgets, or any other sort of apps, .\r\n This works same way as Node Webkit or Electron with a few diferences.\r\n \r\n## Faqs\r\n \r\n * Wy was this build we already have software that does that?\r\n \r\n  * Other available software did not fullfill my needs. This was build out of my desire of learning python, since i love the syntax and i am building some applications with python and HTML and got fed up off building webviews over and over!\r\n  \r\n * Does this comes with a server?\r\n  \r\n  * NO, you dont need a server to build a HTML5, Javascript, CSS3 Application.\r\n  * But if you require one, you can use any server you like or even build your own!\r\n  \r\n * Do i need to know Python?\r\n  \r\n  * NO!\r\n \r\n * Is this cross platform?\r\n \r\n  * This works on Linux, but there is Python Gobject for Windows and MacOx. I have not tested on the lastest 2 since am only trageting Linux for now, it should work!\r\n\r\n * Does it work with PyPy\r\n \r\n  * Perhaps! there is a version of PyGobject for PyPy, but that was not tested.\r\n  \r\n## Features\r\n * You can use any scripting language you like (PHP, Python, Ruby, Javascript)!\r\n * Use HTML5, CSS3 or Webgl.\r\n * Use any backend server or none at all!\r\n * Have your applications run in the browser with websockets using the GTK Broadway backend.\r\n \r\n## Usage\r\ncomming soon.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n * broadway backend segfaults.\r\n * window shadows that should not be there wen using transparent window in Dock mode.\r\n * missing options in app.json will throw an error.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n*Copyright (c) 2015-2016, Vitor Lopes.
